## How to make cider without an apple press :apple: :green_apple: :beer: :green_apple: :apple:

1. Take 6 keen but poor students*
2. Acquire a bike :bike: and 65-80 litre rucksack each by whatever legal means you can
3. Congregate at the house where 3/6 of the students live and make a plan of attack, referred to hereafter as the "cider house" 

   Oxford has rather a lot of colleges with lots of nice gardens, orchards etc. The group of 6 are at various different colleges giving them legit access to various locations.

4. Decide which orchards/gardens to acquire apples from and begin the acquisition process**
5. Cycle dangerously back to the cider house and deposit the goodies in the bath - large rucksacks full of apples are quite hard to cycle with!
6. Acquire more apples, this time we opt not to ask for permission and just climb the wall of one of the college houses (my college) - we find pears in this garden too :smiley: :pear: :smiley:
7. Realise you can't get back over the wall with rucksacks full of apples so persuade the students inside the house to let us out via the front door.  
8. Deposit goodies in bath/bathroom
9. Eat lunch
10. Start cider making at just after noon. The process is described below:
```
    2 folks with sharp knives and chopping board -  apples get chopped into smallish bits
    1 person on the food processor - apples get pulped
    2 folks with muslin bags - juice is squeezed into containers and containers emptied into brew bins for fermentation
    1 person making cuppas, snacks, fetching apples from bath, transporting the juice to the brew bins etc
```
11. We all rotate round the different jobs. The owner of the food processor gets worried we might kill the motor - we don't but it was close!
12. About 6-7pm we get hungry so food is BBQd and a few beers are cracked open. The occupants of the cider house make their own beer too (it's how Mike and I got into brewing). We also need to free up a few bottles for the cider to go in, or that's our excuse. Somehow, despite the addition of beer we all keep our digits intact. 
13. By 10pm we're all pretty knackered, we've probably got enough for about 120 pints but there's still a bath full of apples!
14. Add yeast to each of the brew bins containing the apple or pear juice and let chemistry do its magic - bloop bloop bloop

For the next few days no one can face returning to the apple mountain.

After about a week, one of the residents of the cider house (not one of the folks involved in making it) loses the plot at the apples in residing in the bath :bath: :angry:

We all return to finish the job, step 10 resumes but this time a few apples and pears may have turned a little - oops.

After a long hard evening of chopping, juicing etc another 80 pints of apple juice have been produced and the yeast is added. 

15. About a week or so after the yeast was added the cider was decanted into bottles. That was another reason for needing the bath back, washing/sterilsing 120 bottles kinda needs a bath or similar large receptacle.

Once both batches are bottled there's about 200 pints of cider needing drunk.

A month or so after bottling the, cider house throw a bbq/bonfire/firework party inviting all of Earth sciences to join. :fire: :fireworks: :poultry_leg: :beers: :meat_on_bone: :corn:. Thankfully we avoid any fire engines :fire_engine:, although the person who thought the bonfire would light better if he lobbed some used car engine oil on it was very wrong! That resulted in everyone hiding indoors until the toxic stuff had burnt off. 

Those of us that knew which bottles might have had some slightly foosty apples or pears in the batch sensibly sniff the contents before quaffing. However, many didn't seem to care as it was free. We'd a great night with fireworks, bonfire and BBQ and somehow managed not to set fire to anything we weren't meant to burn (engine oil excepted). Quite a few sore heads the next day :smiley: :yum: :dizzy_face:

*These students are studying for D.Phils (a PhD to normal folks but Oxford likes being a bit different) in the Department of Earth Sciences at Oxford University. One might actually have been a postdoc by then but as he lived with others in the cider house we'll just gloss over that bit. Earth Sciences Departments are often a bit different from more traditional science subjects. You get a lot of outdoorsy types, folks that do field work, live in tents for months whilst mapping geology or go bashing rocks or whatever. We'd lots of good social events where staff and students mixed. 

**Some were acquired with full permission - we'd been told we could have any windfalls. What the college staff possibly didn't realise was that poor students can be quite inventive and after realising there weren't enough windfalls someone decided to climb the trees and encourage more to fall off...it turns out quite a lot of apples can be persuaded to the ground that way!
